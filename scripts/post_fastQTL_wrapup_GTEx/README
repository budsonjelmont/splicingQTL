qtls*.txt file format:

sid:SNP id
sid_chr:SNP chr
sid_start:SNP start
sid_end:SNP end
dist:distance from SNP to phenotype
pid:Phenotype id
pid_chr:Phenotype chr
pid_start:Phenotype start
pid_end:Phenotype end
slope:Regression slope
bpval:P value
qval:FDR-corrected P value

Addtl columns may include:
sid_enst/ensg: transcript/gene the SNP overlaps
pid_enst/ensg: transcript/gene the phenotype overlaps 
snp_in_sgene: (T/F) is the SNP located inside the same gene as the phenotype?
