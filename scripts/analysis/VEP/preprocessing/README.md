identify_SNPs_in_cis_window.sh - Reads in .bed files of all SNPs and phenotypes tested for QTL analysis and return all the SNPs that fall within the specified window size (should be the same as that used in fastQTL) from any phenotype
extract_QTL_SNPs_1kg.sh - Reads in a .txt file containing chr:pos for a list of SNPs (one per line) and extracts those SNPs (by range) from a reference VCF file
